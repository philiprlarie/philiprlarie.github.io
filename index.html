<p>I’m a web developer living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>
I grew up in good old New Hampshire and went to school there too. At Dartmouth College, I got a BA Physics with a minor in Engineering.
</p>
<p>
The coding bug bit me one day when I had to create a graph to show the autocorrelation of a 2 dimensional annular ring for a physics class on Optics. The calculations were really annoying and I would have had to do many calculations for different sized rings. Instead of spending my time with pen and paper, I sat down at my keyboard a banged out a Matlab script to generate the plot for me. It may have taken a little bit longer, but the satisfaction at the end was worth it.
</p>

<p>
Since then, I knew coding was where it’s at. I started learning Ruby on my own. I applied and was accepted to App Academy, an intensive, 12 week long web development bootcamp. I learned the full stack there. Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone.js, HTML, CSS, SQL, git.
</p>

<p>It feels great to have these tools under my belt. Check out some of the things I’ve made!</p>
